                <p class="text-warning text-center">How does JS work ?</p>
                <p class="">As JS is an interpreted language , when we run a JS program,browser engine reads line by
                    line from top to bottom and source code goes through several steps and gets executed. The first step
                    is - our source code is received by browser engines(Chrome uses V8 engine) parser and checks code
                    for syntactic errors line by line , throws error and stop execution if error found. After parsing
                    the codes with no errors, v8 engine creates the data structure from our code called AST(Abstract
                    Syntax Tree).When the Abstract Syntax Tree is created by the parser , the JS engine converts our
                    code into the machine code(byte code) and send it to the system for execution . Finally, machine
                    code or byte code run by the system and we see output in the browser .</p>

                <p class="text-warning text-center">What does JS event loop do ?</p>
                <p class="">Event loop gives multi-threaded, non-blocking and asynchronous features to the
                    single-threaded,synchronous JavaScript language. When Js engine executes , it creates execution
                    centexts, pushes and pops functions to and from the call stack in the execution phase.When a
                    function takes a long time to execute its called blocking function and blocking function blocks all
                    the next interactions on the page resulting in page hangs.Event loop solves this issue by placing
                    these blocking functions into a queue called a callback queue.Event loop is a constantly running
                    process that keeps track of callstack and callback queue.When the queued function gets completed or
                    execution time matches event loop places the function into the callstack and function gets executed.
                    Thus event loop coordinates between the callstack and callback queue to achieve concurrency and
                    makes the program non-blocking,asynchronous.</p>

            <div class="col-12 col-lg-4">
                <p class="text-warning text-center">localStorage vs sessionStorage</p>
                <p class="">HTML5 Web Storage API is better than cookies because of large amount of storage limit(web
                    storage 5 MB cookie 4KB) and information is never transferred to the server. Web Storage API gives
                    two Objects for storing data - localStorage and sessionStorage with having similarities and
                    diffencnces between them. localStorage stores data with no expiration date means data is not lost
                    when the browser is closed and data is kept until someone deletes it or clears cache. sessionStorage
                    stores data for only one session means data is lost when the user closes the browser or browser tab.
                    Both has four methods - getItem(), setItem, removeItem(), clear(). Uses is - If u want to save a
                    login username and password, it's better to use sessionStorage over localStorage. And again if u
                    want to save a user's settings on their machine, it's better to use localStorage.</p>
